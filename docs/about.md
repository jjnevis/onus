## Onus is an evolving open source idea, owned and run by anyone and everyone, with the single goal of saving our wonderful planet.

# This is the story of how we save the world.

250 years ago a brilliant economist called Adam Smith created what would become the theory on which all economic activity is based. It was transformative and for many years created wealth and prosperity. Unbeknownst to him it had a flaw that would become a ticking time bomb. You see, Adam Smith believed that the world had an infinite capacity to absorb waste. The result of this error is that the goal of commerce became to maximise waste. Whether we like it or not, this what the global system desires. BOOM.

Fortunately, some 160 years later another brilliant economist named Arthur Cecil Pigou realised this error and proposed a fix. You simply have to include the clean up cost in the overall cost of your economic activity. Unfortunately he called it a tax and because of this it has largely been ignored. Until now.

Paradigm shifts happen when the global collective consciousness realigns it's understanding behind a new truth. Moving from a flat earth to a spherical earth would be one example of this.

A new paradigm shift is going to happen. The world will realise that we can implement the Pigouvian Correction simply by collectively choosing to do it. Pigou solved the problem 100 years ago and we are only now, at the eleventh hour, going to implement it.

How is this going to happen? We collectively choose to do it by choosing Onus.

What is Onus? Onus is a system that is owned by each and everyone of us, the sole purpose of which is to solve the climate emergency.

It starts with awareness. That moment when you realise this will actually work... I know how to solve the problem.

# EUREKA!

It's not voting for leaders that will solve it for us (although definitely keep doing that), it's not hoping that some clever scientist will solve it (although hopefully they will and Onus will enable them), it's not gluing ourselves to things, it's not switching lights off or not eating meat or planting trees or protecting the oceans, insulating houses, building wind farms...

It's all of these things, but these things are complex and involved. It's not easy for individuals to understand how they can help, until now.

Onus makes it very simple for everyone to help save the planet, so easy in fact that literally anyone and everyone can do it, even a world leader or a child.

All you have to do is:

# BE IN ONUS

How do you be in Onus?

# ONLY BUY FROM PEOPLE/COMPANIES IN ONUS

That's all, that's it. If everyone is in Onus then you can't sell anything unless you too are in Onus and this filters right up to the mining companies selling fossil fuels.

Mining companies are a special case. In order for them to be in Onus they must also donate a percentage of the sale value of their mined product when it is first sold. That product is then branded "In Onus" which enables the mining company to declare they are In Onus and therefore eligible to sell their product.

How do we start this?

It has to start with awareness - tell people about onus, share on social media, discuss in the pub.

Ask **"Are you in Onus?"** before buying things and tell them that they will have to be in Onus if they want to continue to do business in the future.

The real beauty of the way Onus works is that the more we pursue fossil fuels, because they are not going to be easy to give up, the harder we work at saving the planet, the solution is baked into the economic machine so we can harness the power of consumerism to save the planet, we can just increase the Onus rate. The consequence of consumerism becomes a beautiful, healthy, vibrant planet.

And... relax.
