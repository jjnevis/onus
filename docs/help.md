Yes - Onus needs your help!

We need people to get behind Onus and make it work for everyone. If you can help in any way at all please get in touch, in fact people getting in touch is one of the things we need help with.

In the long term Onus is going to need many people to manage it successfully and all these people will be well rewarded. However, our immediate need is for volunteers to help with getting the word out and building a global movement.

You can help by simply sharing social media posts with friends and family, but what we really need is believers to create content, develop the website, begin to put more flesh on the bones of the idea that is Onus.

We need a way of managing members, of making decisions democratically, of designing and building the system that will collect, process and distribute the money that is provided by the purchasing of fossil fuels. We need a system to manage projects funded by Onus

We are at the beginning of a truly momentous journey and we need your help please.
