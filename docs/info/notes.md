Onus is bootstrapped. If people or institutions want to invest in Onus then they have to donate money or time.
Insulate Britain - if it's the right thing to do, then it should be done. This is the purpose of Onus.
Onus bakes in the true cost of resource consumption. You don't run a kitchen without a pot washer, eventually you run out of pots, so you have to include the cost of cleaning pots when running a kitchen
Just 1% of annual revenue from fossil fuel mining is 60 billion dollars.
We've got to stop asking world leaders to solve the problem for us, that has not worked.

We used to think the world was flat. Spoiler alert, it's not.

Greta Thunberg, are you in onus?

Pigovian taxes are named after English economist Arthur Cecil Pigou.
100 years ago.

Thank you My Octopus Teacher guy - Craig Foster

Thank you Rebecca Nora Bunch. Everybody loves you.

Talk about the personal side of it questioning myself, why have I not started it already? Because I know it will work.  Because it has to. Period.

Rebecca, you like a live show?

Bill Gates, you sponsored Kurzgesagt "can YOU fix climate change" video with a thumbnail that simply said "NO". Please change that to "YES" and from 9:40 in Choose Onus Plus.

Kurzgesagt please do a video to explain how onus works.

Ever since the first person stoked a fire, I don't think they have ever (in that moment) thought I should look after the forest, â€¦.until now.

We can do it. It's very simple. Choose onus plus.

George Monbiot - would you choose onus.plus?

Nick Moss of London - we don't ditch capitalism, we fix it. Onus introduces a new lever that redirects unconstrained consumption to power environmental protection. It's a positive feedback loop with a dial that we can turn up.

What does COP stand for? Choose onus plus!  (That's my opening!!!)

To the people who know me, and I can tell you, there are some very smart cookies out there: please do everything you can to make this idea work, I know you will.

Share, share, share.
